## YAP: Yet Another Programming Language

YAP is a new programming language designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to use. Written entirely in C, it utilizes CMake and Clang for building and compilation. While its name may evolve over time, its goal is to empower developers with a straightforward language for tackling modern programming challenges.

### Features

- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and efficient runtime.
- **Modern Syntax**: Combines simplicity with flexibility.
- **Open Source**: Contributions and improvements are welcome!
