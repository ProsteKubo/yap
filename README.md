## YAP: Yet Another Programming Language

YAP is a new programming language designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to use. Written entirely in C, it utilizes CMake and Clang for building and compilation. While its name may evolve over time, its goal is to empower developers with a straightforward language for tackling modern programming challenges.

### Features

- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and efficient runtime.
- **Modern Syntax**: Combines simplicity with flexibility.
- **Open Source**: Contributions and improvements are welcome!

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:
- **CMake**: [Download CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- **Clang**: [Install Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)

#### Building YAP

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yap.git
   cd yap
   ```

2. Create a build directory and run CMake:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

3. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

#### Running YAP

After building, you can run the YAP interpreter or compiler (depending on implementation):
```bash
./yap <source_file>.yap
```
